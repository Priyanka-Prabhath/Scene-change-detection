Given a discrete predefined colour space (e.g. Red, Green, Blue), a colour histogram h(.) can be generated by counting the number of times each colour occurs in the image array. Histogram intersection can be used to match a pair of histograms. Given a pair of histograms, e.g., of an input image I and a model M, each containing n bins, the intersection of the histograms is defined as Î£min[h(Ij),h(Mj)]nj=1.
